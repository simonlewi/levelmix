## Development

### Running in Development Mode

1. **Start Redis**
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

2. **Start the web server**
   ```bash
   go run core/cmd/server/main.go
   ```

3. **Start the worker (separate terminal)**
   ```bash
   go run core/cmd/worker/main.go
   ```

### Testing Audio Processing

1. Create a test MP3 file or use any existing audio file
2. Upload through the web interface at `http://localhost:8080/upload`
3. Monitor the processing in the worker logs
4. Download the normalized result

### Database Management

The application uses Turso (SQLite-compatible) as its database. The schema is defined in `schema.sql`:

```bash
# Connect to your database
turso db shell your-database-name

# Run a query
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;

# View tables
.tables

# View schema for a table
.schema users
```
